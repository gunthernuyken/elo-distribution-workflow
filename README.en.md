# ELO Distribution Workflow

Start an ELO workflow based on a predefined template and dynamically assign workflow nodes to users resolved from their email addresses.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Resolves ELO user IDs from email addresses
- Clones a workflow template and activates it
- Dynamically creates a workflow node for each user
- Connects all generated nodes to an existing target node (e.g., `node2`)
- Starts the workflow programmatically from an external application (e.g., Dokuman)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- The template workflow must contain a placeholder node named `EMPFAENGER_TEMPLATE`
- This node must already be connected to a target node (e.g., `node2`)
- The end node (target node) should **not** be manually modified or deleted

---

## üß© Technical Background

This solution replaces outdated email distribution lists with native ELO workflow structures. Each recipient receives their own workflow node, independent of others ‚Äì allowing for parallel information distribution without triggering workflow completion prematurely (as would happen with ELO's ParallelNode).

This technique avoids:
- Group-based nodes where only the first recipient processes the task
- Manual acknowledgment or read receipts
- Outlook-based duplication and document scattering

## üß™ Example Usage

```vbnet
Dim flowId As Integer = StartVerteilerWorkflowAusTemplate(
    objId := "123456",
    workflowName := "Distribution: Engineering Task",
    emailAdressen := New List(Of String) From {
        "user1@example.com",
        "user2@example.com"
    }
)
